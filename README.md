# Mastering GROUP BY, HAVING, Window Functions & Advanced Aggregation Queries

# Project Overview
This project is a hands-on SQL practice dataset designed to strengthen data aggregation, grouping, filtering, and analytical query skills.
It simulates an e-commerce sales dataset with realistic business data ‚Äî customers, products, orders, revenues, and regions ‚Äî to demonstrate SQL proficiency from basic to advanced level.

# Database Setup
Database Name: aggregate_
Table Name: sales
üîπ Columns Description
Column Name	Data Type	Description
order_id	INT (PK)	Unique order identifier
customer_name	VARCHAR(50)	Customer‚Äôs full name
customer_email	VARCHAR(50)	Customer‚Äôs email
product_name	VARCHAR(50)	Product purchased
product_category	VARCHAR(30)	Category (Electronics, Books, etc.)
unit_price	DECIMAL(10,2)	Price per unit
quantity	INT	Quantity purchased
order_date	DATE	Date of the order
order_status	VARCHAR(20)	Order status (Shipped, Delivered, etc.)
shipping_region	VARCHAR(20)	Shipping region (North, South, East, West)
payment_method	VARCHAR(20)	Payment method used

# Data Description
‚Ä¢	Total Rows: 30
‚Ä¢	Categories Covered: Electronics, Books, Apparel, Home Goods, Fitness
‚Ä¢	Regions Covered: North, South, East, West
‚Ä¢	Multiple Payment Methods: Credit Card, PayPal, Debit Card
‚Ä¢	Includes repeat customers and varied order statuses to make analysis realistic.

# Query Levels
üü¢ BASIC LEVEL (1‚Äì10)
Covers fundamental aggregation and grouping concepts.
Examples:
‚Ä¢	Count total orders
‚Ä¢	Calculate total revenue
‚Ä¢	Find total quantity per product
‚Ä¢	Group by order_status and region
‚Ä¢	Average price per category
üü° INTERMEDIATE LEVEL (11‚Äì20)
Introduces HAVING, multi-column grouping, and conditional filtering.
Examples:
‚Ä¢	Customers with more than 2 orders
‚Ä¢	Top 3 product categories by revenue
‚Ä¢	Average order value per region
‚Ä¢	Distinct category count per customer
‚Ä¢	Revenue per payment method
üî¥ ADVANCED LEVEL (21‚Äì30)
Real-world analytical SQL with CTEs, subqueries, and window functions.
Examples:
‚Ä¢	Customer who spent the most overall
‚Ä¢	Region with highest total sales
‚Ä¢	Compare customer avg. order vs. global avg
‚Ä¢	Top-selling product per category (RANK)
‚Ä¢	Revenue share % by category within region
‚Ä¢	Grand total using WITH ROLLUP
‚Ä¢	Customers who bought both Books & Electronics

# SQL Features Used
‚Ä¢	GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY
‚Ä¢	Aggregate functions: SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), MIN(), MAX()
‚Ä¢	Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTE)
‚Ä¢	RANK() and OVER(PARTITION BY ‚Ä¶) window functions
‚Ä¢	WITH ROLLUP for grand totals
‚Ä¢	Date functions: MONTH(), DATE_FORMAT()

# Tools Used
‚Ä¢	Database: MySQL
‚Ä¢	Editor: MySQL Workbench 
‚Ä¢	Dataset: Custom simulated dataset (30 rows)

# Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, you will:
‚Ä¢	Master aggregation and summarization in SQL.
‚Ä¢	Learn to apply analytical logic with subqueries and window functions.
‚Ä¢	Understand business insights from raw transactional data.
‚Ä¢	Be interview-ready for data analyst SQL challenges.
